# Flatgrep ‚ö°
> Automated searches for boring CLI tools.

Tired of typing by hand `flatpak run com.something.veryobnoxious`?  
Try **Flatgrep** for fuzzy search and grep what you want in just seconds. 

* **Quick test :** 
```bash
flatgrep search "mpv" --flathub 
```

> [!TIP] 
> Without the `--flathub` flag it searches for installed flatpaks

| Action                          | Linux Command                          |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Search on Flathub**           | `flatgrep search "app name" --flathub` |
| **List locally installed apps** | `flatgrep search "app name"`           |
| **Install an app from Flathub** | `flatgrep install "app name"`          |
| **Run an app**                  | `flatgrep run "app name"`              |
