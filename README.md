# Flatgrep ‚ö°*Alpha v0.1.3*
> Automated searches for boring CLI tools.

Tired of typing by hand `flatpak run com.something.veryobnoxious`?  
Try **Flatgrep** for fuzzy search and grep what you want in just seconds. 

* **Quick test :** 
```bash
flatgrep run mpv
```

* **Fast and easy install apps from Flathub:**
```bash
flatgrep install firefox
```

## What is Flatgrep?

**Flatgrep** is a smart, fuzzy-finding command-line wrapper for Flatpak that makes searching, installing, and managing your applications a breeze. It enhances the standard `flatpak` commands with an interactive `fzf` interface, ensuring you find and select the right application quickly, even with typos or partial names.

## Why Flatgrep?

Tired of trying to guess the exact application ID for a Flatpak? The default `flatpak search` can be cumbersome. Flatgrep solves this by providing a powerful and intuitive search layer on top of Flatpak.

* **Typo-proof Searching**: Can't remember if it's `Discord` or `discord`? Just type `disc` and let the fuzzy finder show you the options.
* **Interactive Selection**: No more manually copying and pasting long app IDs like `org.gimp.GIMP`. Just search, select from the list, and let Flatgrep handle the rest. The selected ID is copied to your clipboard automatically.
* **Unified Workflow**: Use one consistent and powerful search tool to find, install, run, and uninstall your Flatpak apps.

## Features

* ‚úÖ **Smart Interactive Search**: Uses `fzf` to provide a fuzzy search interface for both locally installed apps and the entire Flathub repository.
* üß† **Intelligent Filtering**:
    * If there's one perfect match, it's selected automatically.
    * If there are multiple matches, you can choose from an interactive list using `fzf`.
    * If no initial match is found, it falls back to a fuzzy search over the entire list of apps.
* üìã **Clipboard Integration**: The selected application ID is automatically copied to your clipboard for convenience.
* üé® **Rich Terminal Output**: Utilizes the `rich` library for clean, modern, and colorful command-line feedback.
* üöÄ **Full Management Suite**: Provides intuitive commands for `search`, `install`, `run`, and `uninstall`.
